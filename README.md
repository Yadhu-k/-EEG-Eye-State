# -EEG-Eye-State
All data is from one continuous EEG measurement with the Emotive EEG Neuroheadset. The duration of the measurement was 117 seconds.  The eye state was detected via a camera during the EEG measurement and added later manually to the file after analysing the video frames.  '1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state.
